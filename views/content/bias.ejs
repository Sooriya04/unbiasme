            <h2 class="blog-post-title">üß† What Are Cognitive Biases?</h2>
            <p>
              Cognitive biases are predictable mental shortcuts or errors in
              thinking that influence how individuals perceive and judge
              information. Rather than making purely rational decisions, people
              often rely on these mental shortcuts‚Äîshaped by emotion, memory,
              personality traits, and context‚Äîwhich can lead to systematic
              errors in reasoning and behavior
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h4>For example:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Individuals high in Neuroticism tend to exhibit loss aversion
                and the availability heuristic, as they are more emotionally
                reactive and sensitive to negative outcomes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Those with low Openness are more prone to confirmation bias,
                preferring familiar information and avoiding contradiction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Highly Extraverted and Agreeable individuals are more
                susceptible to groupthink and social conformity, valuing group
                harmony over independent judgment
              </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
              <p>
                üî¨according to Rashidi et al. (2021) and models developed by
                Stanovich, certain people are more vulnerable to specific biases
                based on their trait scores. These associations enable
                personalized interventions to improve reasoning and reduce bias
                susceptibility.

            <ol>
              <li>Anchoring Bias:</li>
              <p>
                When buying a car, you see the original price is ‚Çπ10,00,000.
                Even if the seller offers ‚Çπ8,50,000, you think it's a good
                deal‚Äîbecause your brain is "anchored" to the original number.
              </p>
              <li>Loss Aversion:</li>
              <p>
                You decide not to invest in a startup because you‚Äôre more afraid
                of losing money than excited about potential profits.
              </p>
              <li>Confirmation Bias:</li>
              <p>
                If you believe that exercise is better than dieting for weight
                loss, you‚Äôre more likely to read articles that support your view
                and ignore others.
              </p>
              <li>Planning Fallacy:</li>
              <p>
                You believe you can finish a school project in 2 days, even
                though similar tasks previously took a week.
              </p>
              <li>Groupthink:</li>
              <p>
                In a team meeting, everyone agrees to a flawed plan because
                nobody wants to be the one to disagree and disrupt group
                harmony.
