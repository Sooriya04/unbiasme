          <h5 class="card-title">What Are Cognitive Biases?</h5>
          <p>
            Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts our brain takes to help us
            make decisions quickly. But sometimes, these shortcuts lead us to
            think in ways that are not logical or fair. They can affect how we
            judge people, remember things, or make choices — often without us
            even realizing it.

          <h5 class="card-title">What Are Personality Traits?</h5>
          <p>
            Personality traits are the patterns in how we think, feel, and
            behave. They shape who we are — how we interact with others, handle
            stress, solve problems, and express emotions. These traits make each
            of us unique and influence how we see the world and make decisions.

          <h5 class="card-title">How Are Personality and Bias Linked?</h5>
          <p>
            Your personality influences how you think — and that includes how
            you form biases. For example, someone who avoids conflict may
            overlook unfair behavior, while someone who seeks control might
            judge quickly. Personality traits can shape the way we see people,
            situations, and choices.
